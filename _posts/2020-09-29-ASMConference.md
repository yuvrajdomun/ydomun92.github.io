As a data scientist, I am commited to unlock value in the products I build for my clients. I delivered a <a href="https://events.imeche.org/ViewEvent?code=SEM7012&utm_campaign=1971270_CE_SEM7012_Asset-Management-Reliability-for-a-Digital-Age_Email01_All&utm_medium=email&utm_source=dotdigital&dm_i=3X32,1691I,2YXU82,46430,1">talk</a> at the IMeche,
where I shared the lessons I learned from past projects and what my current team at Amey is doing to fight back the '85% Data Science project failure rate' reported by Gartner by asking the right questions:

1. People: Are we fostering a culture of collaboration and encouraging diversity?
2. Technology: Are we embracing change and innovating?
3. Business: Are we clear on the business problems we are solving and the value we are unlocking?
