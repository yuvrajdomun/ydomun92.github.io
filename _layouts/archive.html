          <h2> Welcome to my blog! </h2>
          <p>
            I am Yuvraj, Data Scientist based in London. Welcome to my blog, a place where I share snippets of my Data Science journey. 
            As a Data Scientist, my goal goes beyond creating accurate models; I want to build a holistic understanding of data
             science and master all the components required to make it work!
            The structure of this blog was inspired by the Journey taken by the 'IT' guy in Dan Roberts'
             <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-s/Unleashing+the+Power+of+IT%3A+Bringing+People%2C+Business%2C+and+Technology+Together-p-9781118044506"> book</a>, where the focus
            is bringing people, process, technology together to make IT more agile.
            My blog focusses on three main themes: <b>Data Science</b> (Technology), <b>Data & Operations</b> (People), <b>Data Strategy</b> (Process).          </p>

          <h2>Data Science</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/DataScience.svg">
        <p><b> “We’re at the beginning of a golden age of AI. Recent advancements have already led to invention that previously lived in the
           realm of science fiction — and we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible.” - Jeff Bezos</b></p>
          <p> I am passionate about Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (Neural Networks). I have worked extensively on a wide range of projects both in academia and in the industry to deliver
             data science solutions. However, the pace at which data science technologies are evolving is unprecedented. 
             In my Data Science journey, I experiment with new techniques and try the cool new toys! My current obsession is the application of Causal Inference on Machine Learning Algorithm.

          <h2> Data & Operations</h2>
          <img src="assets/images/DataOps.svg">
          <p><b>“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.” – Albert Einstein. </b></p>
          <p><a href="https://www.dataopsmanifesto.org/">DataOps</a> is to Data Science what DevOps is to Software Development. 
            It used to take at least 6 months to deploy software until the agile revolution took place. As a Data Scientist, 
            I am very familiar with the long and tedious waterfall process I have to follow to get my Data Science Solution to production.
             But there is room for improvement, I am keen to apply lean principles to Data Science to improve the velocity at which data science 
             products are productionised. Do we really need to get stuck behind last century's systems
              and <a href="https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/what-is-code-first.aspx"">code-first</a> thinking
              when delivering Data Science?

          <h2>Data Strategy</h2>
          <img src="assets/images/Strategy.svg">
          <p><b>“By Failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” – Benjamin Franklin. </b></p>
          <p> Everyone wants to do Data Science. We know that hiring an army of PhDs will not help. 
            In my Journey to understand how to help businesses shape their data Strategy,
             I focus on understanding the scope of a Data Strategy, what are the key areas that
              organisation needs to focus on when shaping their data strategy, and how they can drive change in a positive direction.
